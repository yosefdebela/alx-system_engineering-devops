        here there two servers. Each server has it's own web server,
        application server, codebase, and Database. It will be helpful incase
        there is alot of traffic, failure in the other server.
        It also has a HA proxy loadbalancer. This will distribute traffic
        among the two servers
        
        It can be either, Weighted round robin, where each server is weighed
        and the server that weighs more gets frequent requests or Weighted least
        connection, where each server is weighed and request is sent to the one
        with least conections.
        
         SPOF still resides with having one client, over the network.
         Another issue will be if these two servers reside in the same
         datacenter, and in that data center they share the same power source.
         2. There are still security issues. It is using HTTP which is not
         secure as data is being transfered without being encrpted. It lacks
         firewall meaning any incoming traffic has access to the data.
         
         here is no monitoring being done, we don't know whether our web
         is online, working fast, returning error everytime or monitoring
         requests.
